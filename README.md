# Interview Scheduler

Welcome to Interview Scheduler. This app allows you to view, create, edit and delete interviews in 5 appointment slots each day from Mon-Friday, 12-5pm in the afternoon. 

It is a SPA (Single Page Application) built using React.js. Data is persisted by the API server using a PostgreSQL database. The client-side of the application communicates with an API server over HTTP, using the JSON format. 

Enjoy making your schedule!
